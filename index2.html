              Puttaparthi is a great historical and spiritual place. 
              Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba preaches that “Cleanliness is next to the Godliness“.
              So we are supporting to the Nagara Panchayath to clean the streets of Puttaparthi. 
              We have promoted a few volunteers who clean and collect the waste from several identified places in Puttaparthi 
              deposit the waste in dust-bins which is later transported to the waste yard. Thus, the organization is involving the 
                 communities in the sanitation aspects.
